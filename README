Conway's Game of Life

An in browser application to allow to running of Conway's Game of Life.

While in Edit Mode, click a cell to either bring it to life, or to kill it off.
In Play Mode, watch as cells die, survive or reproduce accordingly to the rules of the Game Of Life (Wikipedia, 2014):

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
